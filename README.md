This repo is used for the Serverless Architecture Course at Universidad ORT

## Exercises

We use 2 libraries in order to do the exercises of the lessons, [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
We divide the course in two, the first half using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), and the exercises will be pushed to this repo.
